I'm Nasser, a recent graduate of the wonderful [mathematics department](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) at  the University of Michigan. Though I did plenty of pure mathematics during my time there, these days I am mostly interested in  applications of mathematics to ecology, and hope to continue my studies in this area in the future. Nevertheless, I continue to learn all sorts of mathematics whenever I get the chance, which inspired the creation of this blog.



I hope to write about my thoughts on mathematics-related topics from the very theoretical (number theory, topology, probability, etc.) to the very applied (information theory, ecology, quantum mechanics, etc.). Hopefully a true [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) through all things related to mathematics!

Since it's potentially my area of specialization, I have included a link to see [posts](https://mohammnas.github.io/randomwalks/blog-ecology/) specifically related to ecology.

Besides looking for new things to write about here, my hobbies include caring for my large collection of [southern African succulents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizoaceae) and playing guitar.
