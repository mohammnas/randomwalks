![about](/Images/about.JPG){: width="250px" align="right"}

I'm Nasser, a recent graduate of the wonderful [mathematics department](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) at  the University of Michigan and current graduate student in the equally great [department of integrative biology](https://integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. I currently do work on theoretical ecology, and will continue my studies in this area in the future. Nevertheless, I enjoy learning about mathematics and complex systems of all sorts whenever I can, which inspired the creation of this blog.

I hope to write expositions of topics I find neat from pure math, applied math, as well as physics, ecology, and even music. There will be a focus on complex systems, which is a highly interdisciplinary area of study by nature, so hopefully this blog becomes a true [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) through all fields of knowledge!

Since it's my current area of specialization, I have included a link to see [posts](https://mohammnas.github.io/randomwalks/blog-ecology/) specifically related to ecology. These posts will usually be informed by recent (post 1990's) research. 

Besides looking for new things to write about here, my hobbies include caring for my large collection of [southern African succulents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizoaceae) and playing guitar.
