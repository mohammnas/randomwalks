![about](/Images/about.JPG){: width="250px" align="right"}

I'm Nasser, a recent graduate of the wonderful [mathematics department](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) at  the University of Michigan and current graduate student in the [department of integrative biology](https://integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. I currently do work on theoretical ecology, and will continue my studies in this area in the future. Nevertheless, I continue to learn all sorts of things outside of this area whenever I get the chance, which inspired the creation of this blog.


I hope to write about expositions of topics from the very theoretical (number theory, topology, probability, etc.) to the very applied (ecology, quantum mechanics, and even music!). In particular, I like to think about complex systems, which is a highly interdisciplinary area of study by nature, so hopefully this blog becomes a true [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) through all fields of knowledge!

Since it's my current area of specialization, I have included a link to see [posts](https://mohammnas.github.io/randomwalks/blog-ecology/) specifically related to ecology. These posts will usually be informed by recent research.

Besides looking for new things to write about here, my hobbies include caring for my large collection of [southern African succulents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizoaceae) and playing guitar.
