Over the years, I have run across countless mathematical ideas which I struggled to understand. Usually, a good way to remedy this is through finding a more suitable exposition on the topic in a book. Every book has its own style of presentation though, and some may not contain what you are looking for. Here I will describe some of the books which I have read/browsed through either in class or in my freetime and give a short review to hopefully help others to decide whether or not they should choose a particular book to learn a topic.

## Analysis

**Analysis I by Terence Tao**

This is a wonderful book for gaining both an intuitive and technical
undestanding of single - variable real  analysis, and it was written by a
prolific mathematician to boot. I used this book to supplement a course
in undergraduate real analysis and found the non-standard concepts
introduced such as "$$\epsilon$$ - closeness" and $$\epsilon$$ -
steadiness" to be extremely clever and useful for understanding sequences.
The book is fairly slow-paced since it begins by constructing the
basic arithmetic operations and the natural numbers, but the payoff
for reading these sections is great once later chapters are reached.
Overall, this is a fantastic book which will help to cultivate a deep
understanding of analysis.


## Algebra

**Abstract Algebra: An Introduction by Thomas Hungerford**

This is a fairly good book on the fundamentals of abstract algebra and very <br />
basic number theory, beginning with ring theory then moving onto groups  <br />
(many books introduce groups first). The pace is a bit slow, but nevertheless comfortable,
and there are a lot of examples; many of them very simple and <br /> used just for clarifying
concepts. The book is also unique in that it gives an introduction to
cryptography (RSA, Diffie-Hellman) towards the end, which also reads quite well.
Overall the book is a fairly elementary, yet solid introduction to abstract
algebra. For someone looking towards graduate studies in algebra however,
I would instead recommend Artin's *Algebra*.


## Applied Math

**Introduction to Theoretical Fluid Mechanics by Stephen Childress**
![fluids](/assets/fluids.png){: height="220px" width="150px" align="right"}

This book is a set of lecture notes from the Courant Institute which are quite
good as an introduction to the fundamental theorems and concepts in fluid
mechanics, but are very thin on details for the derivations (as are most
lecture notes). I would recommend this as a reference to someone wanting
to know the most important theorems and applications of ideas such as the
basic conservation laws, Kelvin and Helmholtz's theorems, and some basic gas
dynamics. Although it is not stated explicitly, I would recommend knowing some
of the basics about PDEs before studying the later chapters on gas dynamics $$$$
and sound.

## Differential Equations/Dynamics

**Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations, & Linear Algebra by Hirsch, <br /> Smale, and Devaney**
