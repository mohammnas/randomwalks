Over the years, I have run across countless mathematical ideas which I struggled to understand. Usually, a good way to remedy this is through finding a more suitable exposition on the topic in a book. Every book has its own style of presentation though, and some may not contain what you are looking for. Here I will describe some of the books which I have read/browsed through and give a short review to hopefully help others to decide whether or not they should choose a particular book to learn a topic.

## Analysis

**Analysis I by Terence Tao**

This is a wonderful book for gaining both an intuitive and technical undestanding of single-
variable real  analysis, that was written by a prolific mathematician to boot. I used
this book to supplement a course in undergraduate real analysis and found the non-standard
concepts introduced such as "$$\epsilon$$ - closeness" and $$\epsilon$$ - steadiness" to be
extremely clever and useful for understanding sequences.
The book is fairly slow-paced since it begins by constructing the basic arithmetic operations and
the natural numbers, but the payoff for reading these sections is great once later chapters are reached. Overall, this is a fantastic book which will cultivate a deep understanding of analysis.


## Algebra

**Abstract Algebra: An Introduction by Thomas Hungerford**

This is a fairly good book on the fundamentals of abstract algebra and very basic number theory, beginning with ring theory then moving onto groups (many books introduce groups first). The pace is rather slow and comfortable, and there are a lot of examples; many of them very simple used for clarifying concepts. The book is also unique in that it gives an introduction to cryptography (RSA, Diffie-Hellman) towards the end, which also reads quite well. Overall the book is a solid, yet fairly elementary introduction to abstract algebra.

## Applied Math

**Introduction to Theoretical Fluid Mechanics by Stephen Childress**

This book is a set of lecture notes from the Courant Institute which are quite good as
an introduction to the fundamental theorems and concepts in fluid mechanics, but are very
thin on details for the derivations (as are most lecture notes). I would recommend this
as a reference to someone wanting to know theorems and applications of ideas such as the
basic conservation laws, Kelvin and Helmholtz's theorems, and some basic gas dynamics.
Although it is not stated explicitly, I would recommend knowing some of the basics about
PDEs before studying the later chapters on gas dynamics and sound.
