I am currently a mathematics student at the University of Michigan. I don't specialize
in any particular field of mathematics (yet), but there are certainly results and proofs
which I find more interesting than others. This blog is mainly a tool for myself to explain
some of the ideas I learn in books, class, talks, etc. so that I can better understand them, and
hopefully help others to as well.

In my spare time I care for my many plants and I play guitar.
