I'm Nasser Mohammed, a recent graduate of the wonderful [mathematics department](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) at the University of Michigan. Though I did plenty of pure mathematics during my time there, these days I am mostly interested in applications of mathematics to ecology, and hope to continue my studies in this area in the future. Nevertheless, I continue to learn all sorts of mathematics whenever I get the chance, which inspired the creation of this blog.

I hope to write about my thoughts on mathematics-related topics from the very theoretical (computability theory, topology, probability, etc.) to the very applied (information theory, ecology, quantum mechanics, etc.). Hopefully a true [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) through all things related to mathematics!

In my spare time I care for my large collection of southern African succulents and play guitar.
