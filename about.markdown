I'm Nasser Mohammed, a recent graduate of the wonderful [mathematics department](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) at the University of Michigan. Though I did plenty of pure mathematics during my time there, I became interested in applications of mathematics to ecology, and hope to continue my studies in this area in the future.

This blog is mainly a tool for myself to explain (and hopefully not simply regurgitate) some of ideas from both pure and applied mathematics that I learn in books, class, talks, etc. so that I can better understand them, and hopefully help others to as well.

In my spare time I care for my large collection of southern African succulents and play guitar.
